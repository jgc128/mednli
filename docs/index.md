title: MedNLI â€” A Natural Language Inference Dataset For The Clinical Domain
---

## MedNLI

Natural Language Inference (NLI) is one of the critical tasks for understanding natural language. The objective of NLI is to determine if a given hypothesis can be inferred from a given premise. NLI systems have made significant progress over the years, and has gained popularity since the recent release of datasets such as the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) (Bowman et al. 2015) and Multi-NLI (Nangia et al. 2017).

We introduce MedNLI - a dataset annotated by doctors, performing a natural language inference task), grounded in the medical history of patients. We present strategies to: 1) leverage transfer learning using datasets from the open domain, (e.g. SNLI) and 2) incorporate domain knowledge from external data and lexical sources (e.g. medical terminologies). Our results demonstrate performance gains using both strategies.

## News
 - **April 2022.** MedNLI was translated to Russian and released publicly on PhysioNet! [RuMedNLI: A Russian Natural Language Inference Dataset For The Clinical Domain](https://www.physionet.org/content/rumednli-russian-inference/1.0.0/)
 - **January 2019.** MedNLI is a part of a shared task at  BioNLP 2019! [https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2019](https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2019)
 - **October 2018.** A simple baseline system with pre-trained models is now available! [https://github.com/jgc128/mednli_baseline](https://github.com/jgc128/mednli_baseline)

### Access the data
We make MedNLI available through the MIMIC-III derived data repository. Any individual certified to access MIMIC-III can access MedNLI.

	abstract = {State of the art models using deep neural networks have become very good in learning an accurate mapping from inputs to outputs. However, they still lack generalization capabilities in conditions that differ from the ones encountered during training. This is even more challenging in specialized, and knowledge intensive domains, where training data is limited. To address this gap, we introduce {MedNLI} - a dataset annotated by doctors, performing a natural language inference task ({NLI}), grounded in the medical history of patients. We present strategies to: 1) leverage transfer learning using datasets from the open domain, (e.g. {SNLI}) and 2) incorporate domain knowledge from external data and lexical sources (e.g. medical terminologies). Our results demonstrate performance gains using both strategies.},
